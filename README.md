# VoxelDesigner

This is a Unity project I created to help me design hexagon voxels and assign them to certain patterns in a Unity Editor window and then use those designs to assemble a mesh. It is a work in progress so be aware things may be difficult to understand and some feature that appear there are missing entirely but I am working on implementing them in the future.
